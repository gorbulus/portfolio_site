    <h3>Temple of Jazzy</h3>
    <p>This site is a portfolio project that I am working on to share my work and my passion for travel, food, and puppers.</p>                        
    <p>This site will also act as a launching pad for other projects and apps.</p>
    <p>My goals for this Temple are very simple:</p>                                          
    <ol>
        <li>
            Build and deploy a personal site to share my work and passions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the site as a launching pad for other projects I complete.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rekindle my passion for merging technology and lifestyle.
        </li>
        <li>
            To do something I enjoy, coding!
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Temple of Jazzy</h3>

        The name is in reference to my faithful dog, Jazzy.  She is a good girl.
