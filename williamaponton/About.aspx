    <h3>Temple of Jazzy</h3>
    <p>This is a project site I made to share some of my favorite parts of life; travel, food, and dogs.
       This site will also serve as a place to link all my future proejcts as they deploy.
       My goals for this project are very simple:
        1. Build and deploy a personal site to share my work and passions.
        2. Use the site as a launching pad for other projects I complete.
        3. Rekindle my passion for merging technology and lifestyle.
        4. To do something I enjoy, coding!

        The name "Temple of Jazzy" is in reference to my Pit/Lab mix of the same name.
